# SART_Automation
Project to automate Cascade Orienteering Club's SART bracket / heat set up and calculations.

The intent of this project will be to take what I've been doing in Excel with formulas  
(and having to manually update if number of people per heat changes),  
and create a program that will allow a user to define parameters and have the bracket created.
