This will result in a full 40 person upper half of the bracket, and full 20 person upper half of the bottom half of the bracket.  The lowest 9 people will be condensed into 2 heats instead of 4 after Round 2, final shuffling up/down will occur in Round 3, and then they will have a combined time score staying in the same heat for Round 4 and 5."
